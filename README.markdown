# Check for Drupal sites updates

When you have a lot of sites on your server, some of them Drupal, some not, it can be very boring to check if every single site is up to date.
Of course you can set up Drupal to warn you, but sometime is easy to just log in into the server and do that to all sites. But since you have a lot of sites, remember which is Drupal and which isn't can be a huge task. For this task this script has been created.

The only thing this script do is check if a site is made with Drupal and if so, verify if it is up to date. Only that.

## Dependencies

This script has been tested only on a unix environment, so don't hope it works on Windows.

You must have **drush** installed as well to it do the verification.

## Other features

There are no plans for other features. This is enough for me, but feel free to fork it and make your own customization.

## Licensing

This script is licensed under the GPL V2.
